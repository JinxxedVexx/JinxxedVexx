If you're wanting to check out my art, look at my [Twitter](https://x.com/Jinxxed_Vexx), it has most of my art archived on there as I slowly move over to Bsky!

I usually hang around the bakery or spawn, but if you don't see me there I'm probably wandering around!

My bestie [Dayne](https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1898853848405418366) is generally with me, she's pretty nonverbal (most of the time). I tend to play Ponytown in the background, while in call and doing other things, and just hang around to people-watch. I don't mind conversations or meeting people at all! I have a ton of interests and love chatting about them! 

If you're wearing a skin that coincides with mine, feel free to hang around me and vibe!

Currently into: Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure, Cyberpunk 2077, OCs

I have a lot of things I'm interested in...**A LOT**, it's hard to list a bunch on things like these so I usually just do whatever off the top of the dome. Chat me up and I'll more than likely be into at least one thing you're into.

## DNI
- All the basic shit, don't be wack.
- If you're a minor and I'm on the 18+ server, do not interact with me. You're intruding on a space intended for adults. If I'm on the other server, I don't mind chatting with you.
- If you're hypercritical of morally grey or dark characters (let them have hobbies!)
- You're purposefully baiting, overly edgy or doing an unfunny bit.
- If you're deep into terminally online fandom spaces.

I can usually tell pretty easily if I want to interact with you or not, I'm pretty easy-going/mellow so I don't actually have a lot of grievances and it takes a lot to off-put me.

### Please don't copy my skins 1:1. You're more than welcome to take inspiration from them, though!
